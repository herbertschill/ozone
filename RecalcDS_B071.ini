(0)  recent calibrations (02.11.2020):

       B040  Cal18b
       B071  Cal18a
       B072  Cal16a
       B156  Cal18a
       B163  Cal17a

(1)  Input data will be read from one of the following sources:

     BRaw  B-files as raw-data (recalculation from raw counts)
     BSum  B-files as summary-data (recalculation from summary data)
     DS    DS-files (recalculation from existing O3-resp. SO2-values)
              
(2)  Instrument constants will be read from one of the following sources:

     0 or B or DS    constants from 'inst'-values from B-file (for input
                     data=BRaw/BSum) resp. DS-file (for input data=DS)
     1 or ICFjjjyy   constants from standard 'ICFjjjyy.iii'-file
     2 or ICFCalxxx  period constants from 'ICFCalxxx.iii'-file

(3)  In all filenames or pathnames following replacements are done:

       string 'iii' is replaced by Brewer instrument identifier
       string 'yyyy' is replaced by year
       string 'Calxxx' is replaced by calibration, e.g. 'Cal18b'

(4)  If path=0, no daily mean files are generated

(5)  A list of available Abs.Coeff. types and its values are given below; if the name ends with
     'Teff', effective stratosphere temperatures (from Payerne) are used for the daily correction 
     of the absorption coefficients

(6)  Relative difference of required abs.coeffs. to operational BassPaur abs.coeffs. for standard
     temperature

(7)  If temperature dependence is equal zero, no stratosphere temperature correction is applied

(8)  Path and name of file containing effective stratosphere temperatures is listed under [Teff]
     in this constant file
