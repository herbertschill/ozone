(1) Gives the difference between real horizon elevation and the sun elevation to guarantee
    that direct sun measurements start not too early resp. end too late

(2) Minimal sunheight for measurements: if the real horizon lies deeper than this value, the
    latter will be used for the calculation of sunrise/sunset time

(3) Chose the detail for the output file: 1 = only jdn, Sunrise and Sunset elevation [deg]
                                          2 = full information about azimuth, suntrack, horizon
