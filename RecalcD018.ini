#  'RecalcAE.R' recalculates Dobson D018 total ozone, reading the raw data from the 
#  'Djjjyyyy.iii' files, results are written to 'Djjjyyyy.iii' files or an all day file 
#  'SingOzon_year1-year2_Calxxx.iii' located in the same or another directory.
#
#  Day statistics values (mean, stadev, number of measurements) are written to the 
#  dayfile "DAYOZON_yyyy.iii" ( data of one year or a part of a year, iii=Dobson 
#  identifier).


(1)  If value=0, the period RN-tables according to the Delta-N-Correction table are used;
     RN-table filename is usually 'O3DRNT_yyyyn.iii' ('n' may be a letter, a number,
     or be omitted, if there is only one table in a year, which is normally the case); 
     this is the same file as used by Martin Stanek programs 'O3Dobson.exe' and 
     'O3DRec.exe'; the Dobson Instrument identifier string will replace the 'iii' string, 
     if necessary

(2)  If a instrument identifier in the path or the filename is written as 'iii' the  
     Dobson Instrument identifier string will replace the 'iii' string

     If a year number in the path is written as 'yyyy' the appropriate year will be
     set in a single or multiple year proceeding at this position

     If a calibration identifier in the path or the filename is written as 'Calxxx' the  
     Calibration info string from line 3 will replace the 'Calxxx' string

(3)  The following Absorption Coefficients sets are available:

     BaPaWMO        Bass-Paur WMO-paper RDP 825 from 18.12.1991, in use since 01.01.1992
     IGACOBP        Bass-Paur IGACO quad temperature parametrization
     IUPSerdy       IUP Quad temperature parametrization (Serdyuchenko)
     IUPGorsh       IUP ATMOZ Quad temperature parametrization (Gorshelev)
     Bernhd05       Bernhard 2005, only at -46.3C (226.85 K) temperature
     BaPaNom        Bass-Paur nominal used in InfO3RS-project of PMOD-WRC
     BremNom        Bremen nominal used in InfO3RS-project of PMOD-WRC
     Vigroux        Vigroux nominal 1957, in use since 1962

(4)  If time reference is UTC, measurement time is corrected to UTC for output, 
     otherwise (LOC) it remains unchanged

(5)  'DD'-format corresponds to the file-format used by Martin Stanek programs 
     'O3Dobson.exe' and 'O3DRec.exe';'AD'-format is a one line per measurement sequence 
     file for wavelengths A, D, AD (similar to O3.prn-output of 'O3Dobson.exe')

(6)  If the info string contains calibration info in the format 'Calxxx', the proper
     calibration info string from line 4 will replace the 'Calxxx' string

(7)  If filter is required, data for daily means can be filtered by flag:

        Filter value     effect
              0          no filtering
              1          filtering by measurement type [DS/ZC] only
              2          filtering by [FlagMin, FlagMax] only
              3          filtering by both type and flag boundaries

     In the daily output files 'Djjjyyyy.iii'  a l l  measurements
     appear, but flagged values are not used for the daily statistics
