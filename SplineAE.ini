     Frequently used pathes:

     C:\PMOD\Dobson\Data\AE\iii\Calxxx\yyyy\  
     C:\PMOD\Dobson\Data\LV\iii\yyyy\
     C:\PMOD\Dobson\MetaData\IC2017\

(1)  If the substring 'LV' appear in the name of the input-path, the respective data 
     format is selected as input, otherwise 'AE' is the default format

     If a instrument identifier in the path or the filename is written as 'iii' the  
     Dobson Instrument identifier string will replace the 'iii' string

     If a year number in the path is written as 'yyyy' the appropriate year will be
     set in a single or multiple year proceeding at this position

     If a calibration identifier in the path or the filename is written as 'Calxxx' the  
     Calibration info string from line 4 will replace the 'Calxxx' string

(2)  Indicates which are the possible start times for the C-measurement: e.g. a value of
     4 means that splined C-measurements will be calculated for hh:00, hh:04, hh:08 etc,
     a value of 1 will lead to times for hh:00, hh:01, hh:02 etc; D-measurement will be
     calculated for 1 min later than C, A-measurement for 2 mins later than C. A value
     of 9 means that times are taken from the reference instrument file.
